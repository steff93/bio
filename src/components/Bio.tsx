      <p>
        I'm Stefan, a versatile and passionate front end developer who has been
        working in the tech industry for more than 9 years. I believe in
        building software that solves real issues and focuses on good user
        experience. I stand for clean code practices and good design. I mostly
        have expertise with React and TypeScript - but can work with any
        framework.

        Feel free to contact me for any suggestions or collaborations.
